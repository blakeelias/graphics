I tweaked my draw.c file to interface with Felix's SDL setup.

To demonstrate the realtimeyness of SDL, this program plots a line with random endpoints and a random color every 0.5 seconds.

This particular program only runs on GNOME. The "lines" executable was built using the libraries libsdl1.2-dev and libgtk2.0-dev.
