README:

To run, execute main.

Make sure you have a spare line at the end of the script.  Also, my terminal won't let me display more than 3 or 4 times (the code is supposed to be a simple animation, but it craps out pretty quickly).  Other than that, everything seems to be working quite spiffily.
Cheers.
