EDIT 4/22, 2AM: The error was that I assumed that the reciprocal of the step would work nicely. it does not. In any case, I managed to get most of my code running in less than a few hours of finding this out. Sorry it took so long, the PSU for my linux box just came back today. The hermite curve is still not fully operational and there is still a random segfault at the end that does not seem to do anything, but other than that there are no known issues with this code.

Original:
Everything but the hermite curve has been seriously attempted, though to date nothing works.
At 4 AM, 4/5, I tried testing with various draw.c's from my peers, and assuming that at least one works, Ive been debugging the wrong file for the past few weeks.
With the project due in <4 hours as of writing, I don't exactly have the time to completely address the issue, but I will continue working on it.
