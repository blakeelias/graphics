My project is to implement the Graphics stuff 
(making shapes, making polygons, shading, lighting, 3D rendering, etc.)
into a java GUI so that the user can customize everything and make 2D and/or 3D drawings.

It has the basic shapes and some shading. It is set up to do the lighting, but I confused
myself one too many times and moved on to other things.
There are a lot of bugs, most of which I tried to fix, but many of which I did not.
I spent a lot of time (more than I expected to) just trying to get the gui to memorize
the colors that were selected. I thought of a few simpleways which I was almost certain
would work, but they didn't, and that wasted a lot of time.
