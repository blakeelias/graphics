Note: This program requires SDL to compile



This program is a modified mdl implementation.
Most notable is the additional command "navigate",
which opens up a navigateable 3D display of the
mdl animation. Controls are:

W: Move Forward
S: Move Backward
A: Move Left
D: Move Right

Up Arrow:    Look Up
Down Arrow:  Look Down
Left Arrow:  Turn Left
Right Arrow: Turn Right

R: Reset position
Q: Quit
