-------------------- Now You're thinking with Portals --------------------

By Sam Szuflita (and only Sam Szuflita)

This project will extend MDL to incorporate portals.  For those of you who have been living under a rock for the last few years, portals act like wormholes, connecting two points in space.  In the game Portal (upon which I will be basing the behavior of my portals), the user creates portals (2-dimensional ovals).  Every portal has a complimentary portal (they are usually color coded orange and blue).  When an object enters a portal, it is transported to the complimentary portal with its momentum unchanged.
