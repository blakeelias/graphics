portal x1 y1 z1 r1 t1 t2 t3 x2 y2 z2 r2 t4 t5 t6

This command creates a portal p1 at x1, y1, z1, of radius r1 with angles t1, t2, and t3 with respect to the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.  It also creates an antiportal p2 at x2, y2, z2 of radius r2 with angles t4, t5, t6 with respect to the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.

Any point which passes through portal p1 will come out of portal p2.  It should be rotated as well to match the new direction, but I don't have angle support yet.

The program also doesn't visualize the portals yet.  This isn't hard, it just doesn't make much sense without angle support (all portals would just be straight lines).

As of right now, the code is buggy, but works.  Included is a file animated.gif, which is an example of my code in action.
