We extended the MDL project with new topics from class

The samples/ directory has example MDL scripts and image outputs in PPM and PNG.

What works
----------
Shapes render properly (box, sphere, torus)
multi-colored polygon faces (doritos!)
transformations
animation and knobs
Lighting and flat shading
Hidden surface removal: back face culling and Z buffering

Bugs
----
Outer edge of sphere lights up weirdly when it should be darker (the surface normals must be wrong) -- less noticable with multi-colored faces
Knobs seem to jump around when a vary command doesn't span the entire amount of frames
Unable to implement Phong shading, despite a day of attempts.  Probably related to the first bug, incorect normal for some surfaces
