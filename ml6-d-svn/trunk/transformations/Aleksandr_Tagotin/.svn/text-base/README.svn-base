Java code, should autoparse script files

I was at one point led to believe that I had fully completed the project (until reality set in).
The code appears to work up to the transformation part (that sounded worse that I thought it would), extensive debugging didnt seem to help. Namely, while plain lines graph; application of the transformation matrix destroys my work by the form of a (0,0)'ed matrix. Replacing my code with a peer's for Matrixmult doesn't fully fix this problem (all dimensions but one were (0,0)'ed). 
It appears to occur regardless of which transformation is performed (for the most part).


(speaking of borrowed code, I had to look on to see the proper interaction of the input classes)
