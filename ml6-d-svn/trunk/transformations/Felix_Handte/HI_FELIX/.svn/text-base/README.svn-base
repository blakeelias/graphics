To get myself acquainted with your setup, I tried getting the Add Point and Add Line buttons to draw points and lines, respectively, on the screen.

Lines behave rather... curiously.

Don't make any sudden mouse movements, or the program will crash. Also, don't frown at the screen too much, but don't smile too much, either.

'Night.
