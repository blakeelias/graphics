3D rendering engine built from scratch in C.

Here are some images and animations produced by my final project from Stuyvesant's computer graphics class. I built a 3D graphics rendering and animation engine from the ground up, including line drawing, parametric curve generation and Bezier curves, lighting and flat shading, and motion description language for animation.

The C source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/blakeelias/graphics/tree/main/ml6-d-svn/trunk/final/Mendelias).
